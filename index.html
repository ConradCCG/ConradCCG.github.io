        So, I have currently been invited to work on a credit deal involving an insurance company, where "we" help strucutre a credit investment for them into a private company. I still don't seem to see how the world works truly. I am stuck in a hard headed way of thinking instead of just letting my brain accept what is, is. There is synergistic values between what we talked about vis-a-vis Pakistan but it is not in the way you imagnined. I need my brain to soften and my work drive to pick up.
