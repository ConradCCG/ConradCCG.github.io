       <p>We miss you here in NYC; the cold winter was very hard to stomach without one of New York's warmest personalties. This is my very first website I hope you like it. Way easier than I thought it would be, granted this is a pretty crude website. </p>
       <p> Thank God I can update this website when I want this was not finished when package was sent out</p>
        <h2> Hope you enjoy some of the content </h2>

        The Banner: I spent sometime on its design. The numbers are for a book chyper. I was going to add more but I didn't want to clutter the banner so I made this website to add anything extra.
